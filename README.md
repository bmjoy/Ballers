## Ballers
Unity version 2019.3.12f 3D Game.

Ballers is a 3D multiplayer basketball simulation with the goal of being competitive and skill based.

The game is in VERY early development and I am making it mostly to learn and get better with unity/gamedev. So you will currently receive no support or downloads until further into the project.

Uses voxel models
