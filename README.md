## Ballers
Unity version 2019.2.15f1 3D Game.

Ballers is a 3D multiplayer basketball simulation with the goal of being competitive and skill based.

The game is in VERY early development and I am making it mostly to learn and get better with unity.

Uses 3D voxel graphics.

### Dependencies

* PixaVoxel (Paid Voxel Library in the Unity store)
* MLAPI (Networking Library. Included as dll)
