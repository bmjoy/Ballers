## Ballers
Unity version 2019.2.12f1 3D Game.

The game is in VERY early development and I am making it mostly to learn and get better with unity.

Uses 3D voxel graphics.

Trying both Forge Networking and Photon 2 to see which I prefer more for networking of the game.

### Dependencies
Depends on 2 Unity store libraries

* PixaVoxel
* Forge Networking
* Photon 2 (Can use Free version)
